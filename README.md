My legs are broken, the kneecaps are stolen

I’m forever bound to a chair

I’m half quadriplegic, that means paraplegic

I can’t seem to feel my legs

A desolate life (life)

I can’t please my wife (wife)

If only my legs I could feel

It's legs that I spite as I sit down and fight

The only thing I cannot feel

There will be wheel, chair

The suffer and pain is much to bear

The only one, left

Wheels in motion, fate is set

Because the mountains don't give back what they take

Oh no, there will be wheel, chair

It's the only thing I cannot feel

Losing my mobility

Wondering, "Have I gone insane?"

Hate my disability all I feel is Phantom Pain

Looking downward from this deadly height and wondering if I should end it all
